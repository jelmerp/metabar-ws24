    "text": "3 Interacting with R\n\n3.1 R as a calculator\nThe lower-left RStudio pane, i.e. the R console, is where you can interact with R directly. The &gt; sign is the R “prompt”. It indicates that R is ready for you to type something.\nLet’s start by performing a division:\n\n203 / 2.54\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\nR does the calculation and prints the result, and then you get the &gt; prompt again. (The [1] may look a bit weird when there is only one output element; this is how you can keep count of output elements.)\nWith the standard symbols you can use R as a general calculator:\n\n203 * 2.54   # Multiplication\n\n[1] 515.62\n\n203 + 2.54   # Addition\n\n[1] 205.54\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Trying some random things…\n\n   203     - 2.54\n\n[1] 200.46\n\n\nThis works: so R just ignores any extra spaces. How about:\n\n203 +\n\n\n\n Now the prompt is a +. What is going on? (Click for the answer)\n\nR is waiting for you to finish the command, since you typed an incomplete command: something has to come after the + to be added to what came before.\nWhile it was obvious here, you will often type incomplete commands without realizing you did so. Just remember that when you see the + prompt, you are missing something in your command: often, you’ll have forgotten a closing parenthesis ) or you accidentally opened up an unwanted opening parenthesis (.\n\nPress the Esc button to get your prompt back.\n\nAnd if we just type a number:\n\n203\n\n[1] 203\n\n\nR will print the number back to us! It turns out that the default, implicit action that R will perform on anything you type is to print it back to us (it is calling a function called print() under the hood).\n\nRather than a number, what if we want R to print back to us some text, which in programming lingo is called a “character string”?\n\nFantastic\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Fantastic' not found\n\n\n\n\n What seems to be going wrong here? (Click for the answer)\n\nWhenever you type a character string, R expects to find an “object” with that name. (Or, if you would use parentheses after the string, like string(), it will expect a function.)\nBecause no object called Fantastic exists, R throws an error. To refer to a literal string instead, we need to use quotes (see below).\n\n\nWe can get R to print character strings back to us, and work with them in other ways, as long as we quote the strings:\n\n\"Fantastic\"\n\n[1] \"Fantastic\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm really liking R so far.\"\n\n[1] \"I'm really liking R so far.\"\n\n\nSo, R treats numbers and character strings differently: unlike numbers, character strings need to be quoted. This avoids confusion with objects (we’ll learn about those in a minute) because unquoted character strings are assumed to be objects, and also allows for “special characters” like spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote types\n\n\n\nDouble quotes (\"Fantastic\") and single quotes ('Fantastic') can be used interchangeably in R. Double quotes are preferred by most “style guides”."

    "text": "4 Getting Organized\n\n4.1 Need for Scripts and RStudio Projects\nWe can go along like this, typing commands directly into the R console. But to better keep track of what you’re doing, it’s a good idea to write your code in files, i.e. “scripts”. And when we start creating scripts, we need to worry about how we organize the scripts and data for a project.\nIt is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, and use that folder as the working directory — in the Unix shell and in R alike. RStudio provides a helpful way to keep your working directory constant through its “Projects”. When you use a Project, your working directory will be the top-level directory of that project.\n\n\n\n4.2 Create a new RStudio Project\nTo create a new RStudio Project inside your personal dir in /fs/ess/PAS2714/users (e.g., for me, the dir /fs/ess/PAS2714/users/jelmer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t have a personal dir there? (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you followed the shell homework, you should have created your own dir within /fs/ess/PAS2714/users.\nIf you don’t have one, you can quickly create it as follows:\n\ndir.create(paste0(\"/fs/ess/PAS2714/users/\", Sys.getenv(\"USER\")))\n\n\n\n\n\nClick File (top bar, below your browser’s address bar) &gt; New Project\nIn the popup window, click Existing Directory.\n\n\n\nClick to see a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Browse... to select your personal dir.\n\n\n\nClick to see a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next window, you should be in your Home directory (abbreviated as ~), from which you can’t click your way to /fs/ess! Instead, you’ll first have to click on the (very small!) ... highlighted in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType at least part of the path to your personal dir in /fs/ess/PAS2714/users, e.g. like shown below, and click OK:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you should be able to browse/click the rest of the way to your personal directory, something like /fs/ess/PAS2714/users/jelmer.\nClick Choose to pick your selected directory.\nClick Create Project.\n\nRStudio should reload and you should now have your new Project “open”. Your working directory should be the Project’s directory. We can check this using getwd():\n\ngetwd()\n\n/fs/ess/PAS2714/users/jelmer\nFrom now on, we will not change our working directory, and refer to all files relative to our project’s top-level directory.\n\n\n\n4.3 Create an R script\n\nCreate a new R script (File &gt; New File &gt; R Script)\nClick File &gt; Save As to save the script in the scripts dir that you should see within your personal dir.2 Give it a descriptive name like intro-to-R.R.\n\nFrom now on, type your commands into this script and execute the commands from there.\nTo send code from your script to the console, press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter. This will copy the line of code that your cursor is at to the R console and execute it, and then the cursor will move to the next line.\n\n\n\n4.4 Commenting\nYou can use # signs to comment your code:\n\n# Divide by 2.54 to get the wingspan in inches:\n203 / 2.54    # Original measurement was in cm\n\n\nAnything to the right of a # is ignored by R, meaning it won’t be executed\nYou can use # both at the start of a line (entire line is a comment) or anywhere in a line following code (rest of the line is a comment)\nIn your R script, comments are formatted differently so you can clearly distinguish them from code\n\nWe recommend that you use lots of comments in your R scripts! They are useful not only for others that you may share your code with, but also for yourself when you look back at your code a day, a month, or a year later."

    "text": "5 R objects\n\n5.1 Assigning stuff to objects\nWe can assign pretty much anything to an object with the assignment operator, &lt;-3. (This is a smaller-than sign &lt; followed by a dash -.)\nA few examples:\n\nwingspan_cm &lt;- 203\nconversion &lt;- 2.54\n\nType that into your script, and use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter twice to send it to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Environment tab\n\n\n\nThe objects you create get added to your “environment”, which RStudio shows in the Environment tab in the top-right panel — check that wingspan_cm and conversion are indeed there.\n\n\nAfter you’ve assigned a number to an object, you can use it in calculations like so:\n\nwingspan_cm / conversion\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\nOr, similarly:\n\nwingspan_inch &lt;- wingspan_cm / conversion\nwingspan_inch\n\n[1] 79.92126\n\n\nThis illustrates that when you execute code with objects, R substitutes the object name that you provide by its contents under the hood. In other words, the object is just a reference to the underlying value(s).\n\n\n5.2 Object names\nObjects can be given almost any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. Some pointers on naming:\n\nBecause R is case sensitive, wingspan_inch is different from Wingspan_inch!\nAn object name cannot contain spaces — so for readability, you should separate words using:\n\nUnderscores: wingspan_inch (this is called “snake case”)\nPeriods: wingspan.inch\nCapitalization: wingspanInch or WingspanInch (“camel case”)\n\nYou will make things easier for yourself by naming objects in a consistent way, e.g. by sticking to a case type.\nObject names can contain but cannot start with a number: x2 is valid but 2x is not4.\nMake object names descriptive yet not too long — this is not always easy!\n\n\n Exercises: objects and strings\nA) Which of the following do you think would work and which would return an error:\n\nsession_topic &lt;- \"introduction\"\n\n\nsession_topic &lt;- introduction\n\nTry both to see which works and what error you get for the other one. Also, try to describe in words what the correct line of code is doing.\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nThe first of the two options was correct R code, while the second returns an error.\nIn general, keep in mind that unquoted character strings represent objects whereas quoted character strings are “literals”. Here, we wanted to assign the literal string \"introduction\" to the object session_topic — so the former should be quoted and the latter not.\nAn error is produced when you run the second option, because the object introduction does not exist (unless, of course, you had created an object of that name!):\n\nsession_topic &lt;- introduction\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'introduction' not found\n\n\n\n\nB) Having run the code above, which of the following would make R print \"introduction\"?\n\n\"session_topic\"\n\n\nsession_topic\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nThe second option is the correct one: here, we want to have R print the value of the object session_topic (which we had just created in exercise A), so we shouldn’t use quotes.\n\nsession_topic\n\n[1] \"introduction\"\n\n\n\n\nC) Do you think the following code would successfully add 5 and 7? If not, what might happen instead?\n\n\"5\" + \"7\"\n\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nIn the code above, the “numbers” are saved not as numbers (in R lingo: as a numeric) but as character strings (character).\nR can’t add character strings, so it will return an error:\n\n\"5\" + \"7\"\n\nError in \"5\" + \"7\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\n(Perhaps you expected it to combine/“concatenate” the two strings in some way — this is in fact what Python would do. Or to automatically convert the characters to numbers, since you’re clearly wanting them to be numbers — but it doesn’t do that either.)\n\n\nD) (Bonus) What is the value of y after running the following lines of code?\n\nx &lt;- 50\ny &lt;- x * 2\nx &lt;- 80\n\n\n\n Solution (click here)\n\nObjects don’t get linked to each other, so if you change one, it won’t affect the values of any others. Therefore, y will keep the value 100."

Like for many things you may want to do in R, there is a function for that.\nFunctions are used by typing their name followed by parentheses:\n\nround(203 / 2.54)\n\n[1] 80\n\n\nHere, round() is a function that rounds a number. The value in the parentheses is called a function “argument”, which is used in the execution of the function.\n\n\n6.1 Using named arguments\nFunctions can have more than one argument, and some of them may have default values.\nThere are some functions that take many arguments and it can get confusing trying to keep them in order. In that case, it is better to explicitly name the arguments.\nWhen you type a function name and pause for a moment, the arguments, their names, and their default values (i.e., the value if the argument is left unspecified) will be shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the second argument for round() and what is its default value? (Click here)\n\nround has a second argument digits whose default is 0, such that numbers will be rounded to whole integers.\n\nBelow is an example using named arguments with round().

    "section": "8 Vectors",
    "text": "8 Vectors\nA vector is the most common and basic data structure in R, and is composed of a series of values of the same type5. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function (for “combine”). For example:\n\nwingspans_cm &lt;- c(11.8, 203, 18.2, 27.9)\n\nA vector can also contain characters – but again, quoting is important, or R will think the strings are objects:\n\nbirds &lt;- c(\"hummingbird\", \"bald_eagle\", \"chickadee\", \"cardinal\")\n\nAs mentioned, all of a vector’s elements have to be of the same type of data. The function class() indicates what kind of data you are working with:\n\nclass(wingspans_cm)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(birds)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n8.1 Data types in R\nThe classes we saw above are different types of atomic vectors, R’s simplest data type. The 4 most common atomic vector types are:\n\n\"numeric\" (or \"double\") – floating point numbers (numbers with decimals)\n\"integer\" – integer numbers (no decimals)\n\"character\" – character strings\n\"logical\" – TRUE and FALSE (also known as boolean)\n\nAlso worth mentioning in this context is:\n\nfactor – Character strings with a discrete set of possible values, used mostly for statistical tests and plotting6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Vector coercion – when not all elements are of the same type. (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if we try to mix vector types (e.g., “character and numeric”) in a single vector? R converts them to all be the same type, and it does so without telling us about it. For example:\n\nnum_char &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nclass(num_char)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Vectorization!\nLet’s say we wanted to convert our vector of wingspans to inches: dividing each length in centimeters by 2.54. It turns out that this is as easy as dividing the vector by 2.54:\n\n# wingspans_cm &lt;- c(11.8, 203, 18.2, 27.9)  # Still working with the same wingspans_cm vector\n\nwingspans_in &lt;- wingspans_cm / 2.54\nwingspans_in\n\n[1]  4.645669 79.921260  7.165354 10.984252\n\n\nThis works because R “vectorizes” operations whenever it can. This means that in this case, each element in the vector weights_cm will be divided by 2.54 – this number is recycled to match the number of weights. Very useful!\nSimilarly, we can use two vectors of equal length to quickly operate on each element of the vector:\n\nsizes_cm &lt;- c(7.62, 90, 13.1, 21.8)\n\nratio &lt;- wingspans_cm / sizes_cm\nratio\n\n[1] 1.548556 2.255556 1.389313 1.279817\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Temperature conversion\nRecall that you can convert a temperature of, for example, 26 Fahrenheit to Celcius as follows:\n\n# (26°F - 32) / 1.8 = -3.3°C\n(26 - 32) / 1.8\n\n[1] -3.333333\n\n\nCreate and store a vector with the values 26, 21, 24, 32, 33, 41, 51, representing temperatures in Fahrenheit.\nNow convert all the values in this vector from Fahrenheit to Celcius.\n\n\nClick here for the solution\n\nThanks to R’s vectorization, you don’t have to convert these values 1-by-1:\n\ntemps_f &lt;- c(26, 21, 24, 32, 33, 41, 51)\n\n(temps_f - 32) / 1.8\n\n[1] -3.3333333 -6.1111111 -4.4444444  0.0000000  0.5555556  5.0000000 10.5555556\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Other data structures in R\nWhile vectors can be composed of one of several data types, they, in turn, are one of several data structures that R uses. Other important ones are7:\n\ndata.frame – A rectangular data structure where each column can be a different data type.\nmatrix – A rectangular data structure of a single data type.\nlist – A very flexible data structure that we will not further discuss here."

    "text": "9 Data Frames\nA data frame (formal object type: data.frame) is a rectangular data structure in which:\n\nRows are observations and columns are variables.\nEach column can be of a different type (numeric, character, etc.)\nSince each column is a vector, all the values (cells) within a column are of the same type.\nAll columns have the same length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1 Create, write, and read a data frame\nWe can easily create a data frame by hand using the data.frame() function and “column_name = column_vector” notation for each column:\n\nbirds_df &lt;- data.frame(species = birds,\n                       wingspan = wingspans_cm,\n                       size = sizes_cm,\n                       n_eggs = c(2, 2, 7, 4)) \n\n\nbirds_df\n\n      species wingspan  size n_eggs\n1 hummingbird     11.8  7.62      2\n2  bald_eagle    203.0 90.00      2\n3   chickadee     18.2 13.10      7\n4    cardinal     27.9 21.80      4\n\n\nMost often, however, you’ll be reading your data frames from files. And you’ll also want to save your modified data frames.\nSo let’s practice writing and reading a data frame to and from a “CSV” file — a plain-text, tabular file in which columns are delimited by commas (“Comma-Separated Values” file).\n\n# Write a data frame to CSV format:\nwrite.csv(x = birds_df, file = \"sandbox/bird-data.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious what the file itself looks like?

In there, type the following:\ncat sandbox/bird-data.csv\n\"species\",\"wingspan\",\"size\",\"n_eggs\"\n\"hummingbird\",11.8,7.62,2\n\"bald_eagle\",203,90,2\n\"chickadee\",18.2,13.1,7\n\"cardinal\",27.9,21.8,4\n\n\n\nNow we read our data frame back in from the file:\n\nbirds_df_2 &lt;- read.csv(\"sandbox/bird-data.csv\")\n\nbirds_df_2\n\n      species wingspan  size n_eggs\n1 hummingbird     11.8  7.62      2\n2  bald_eagle    203.0 90.00      2\n3   chickadee     18.2 13.10      7\n4    cardinal     27.9 21.80      4\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 Inspecting a Data Frame\nUse str() to look at the “structure” of the data — it tells us the number rows and columns, and for each column, gives information about the data type and shows the first few values:\n\nstr(birds_df)\n\n'data.frame':   4 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ species : chr  \"hummingbird\" \"bald_eagle\" \"chickadee\" \"cardinal\"\n $ wingspan: num  11.8 203 18.2 27.9\n $ size    : num  7.62 90 13.1 21.8\n $ n_eggs  : num  2 2 7 4\n\n\nFor larger data frames, the head() function, which will print the first 6 rows, is also useful (but is of no real use for a tiny data frame like birds_df):\n\nhead(birds_df)\n\n      species wingspan  size n_eggs\n1 hummingbird     11.8  7.62      2\n2  bald_eagle    203.0 90.00      2\n3   chickadee     18.2 13.10      7\n4    cardinal     27.9 21.80      4\n\n\nFinally, in RStudio, you can open a data frame in a spreadsheet-like manner by clicking on an object in the “Environment” pane, or equivalently, using View():\n\nView(birds_df)\n\n\n\n\n9.3 Functions to get an overview of data frames\n\nSize:\n\nnrow() – Number of rows\nncol() – Number of columns\ndim() – Dimensions: c(number of rows, number of columns)\nlength() – For a dataframe: number of columns.

    "section": "11 Miscellaneous",
    "text": "11 Miscellaneous\n\n11.1 Missing data\nAs R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data (which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented as NA (for “Not Available”).\n\nheights &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)\n\nWhen doing operations on numbers, most functions will return NA if the data you are working with include missing values. It is a safer behavior as otherwise you may overlook that you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument na.rm=TRUE to calculate the result while ignoring the missing values.\n\nmean(heights)\n\n[1] NA\n\nmean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2 Packages\nThe functions that we have been using so far (and many, many more) are available in any R session as soon as you start R (we refer to this functionality as “base R”). However, when doing specialized analyses such as in microbiomics, rather than coding up everything using the basic building blocks in R, we can load add-on code that will allow us to use “high-level” functions specifically geared towards the effective analyses of such data.\nThis type of add-on code is distributed in R packages. The default repository for R packages is CRAN, and you install CRAN packages with the install.packages() function:\n\n# Don't run this\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nIf you’re doing bioinformatic analyses in R, as we will be doing, you will encounter packages that are not on CRAN but are on “Bioconductor”. To install a package from Bioconductor, use the BiocManager package – for example:\n\n# Don't run this\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")  # Install the BiocManager package\nBiocManager::install(\"dada2\")    # Install the dada2 package from Bioconductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation issues at OSC\n\n\n\nThe installation of some packages is tricky at OSC nowadays, and if you were to try the commands above, they would likely fail. With a bit of extra effort, we can install these packages, but during the workshop, we will be using a custom collection of pre-installed packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 Saving your data\nSome very brief notes on saving your data in R:\n\nWe already saw the use of write.csv() to save data frames, and you can also use one of readr’s writing functions.\nTo save R objects “as is”, which can be useful when you’re working with complex S4 objects that may have taken a long time to generate, like a phyloseq object, you can use:\n\n# Don't run this\n\n# Save an object:\nsaveRDS(my_phyloseq_object, \"my_phyloseq_object.RDS\")\n\n# Load it again in a new R session:\nmy_phyloseq_object &lt;- readRDS(\"my_phyloseq_object.RDS\")\n\nA general recommendation is to not rely on your R session to keep things around, especially “overnight”. Devise your workflow such that you are always saving important objects and results outside of R, and can always use your R script to restart from where you left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Change a setting to not let R save your Workspace\n\n\n\nAlong the line of the above, the default behavior of saving and restoring your “Workspace”, which are all the items (objects) that you create during an R session, is bad practice. Instead, you should always recreate your environment from a script and/or saved files with individual pieces of data.\nChange the following setting to prevent R from saving your Workspace whenever you close R:\n\nClick Tools (top bar, below your browser’s address bar) &gt; Global Options\nIn the pop-up window (stay on the General tab), change the settings under the “Workspace” heading to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4 S4 Objects\nWhile the object types we have discussed so far are so-called “S3” objects, we will also be seeing “S4” objects in this workshop. S4 object are commonly used by bioinformatics packages, for instance phyloseq.\nIn a nutshell, S4 objects allow for complicated, multifaceted datasets (e.g. multiple dataframes with and metadata) to be represented in a single object in a standardized way.\nUnlike S3 objects, S4 objects are usually not manipulated by simple assignment with &lt;-, but with specialized functions that are sure to adhere to the strict object definitions."

    "text": "1 FASTQ files\n\n1.1 The FASTQ format\nFASTQ is a very common output format of high-throughput sequencing machines — at least from Illumina sequencing, you will almost always receive the sequences in this format. Like most genomic data files, these are plain text files, and each sequence that is read by the sequencer (i.e., each “read”) forms one FASTQ entry represented by four lines. The lines contain, respectively:\n\nA header that starts with @ and e.g. uniquely identifies the read\nThe sequence itself\nA + (plus sign)\nOne-character quality scores for each base in the sequence\n\n\n\n\nOne entry (read) in a FASTQ file covers 4 lines. The header line is annotated, with some of the more useful components highlighted in red. For viewing purposes, this read (at only 56 bp) is shorter than what is typical.\n\n\nThe “Q” in FASTQ stands for “quality”, to contrast this format with FASTA, a more basic and generic format that does not include base quality scores. FASTQ files have the extension .fastq or .fq, but they are very commonly gzip-compressed, in which case their name ends in .fastq.gz or .fq.gz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFASTQ quality scores (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quality scores we saw in the read above represent an estimate of the error probability of the base call. Specifically, they correspond to a numeric “Phred” quality score (Q), which is a function of the estimated probability that a base call is erroneous (P):\n\nQ = -10 * log10(P)\n\nFor some specific probabilities and their rough qualitative interpretations for Illumina data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhred quality score\nError probability\nRough interpretation\nASCII character\n\n\n\n\n10\n1 in 10\nterrible\n+\n\n\n20\n1 in 100\nbad\n5\n\n\n30\n1 in 1,000\ngood\n?\n\n\n40\n1 in 10,000\nexcellent\n?\n\n\n\nThis numeric quality score is represented in FASTQ files not by the number itself, but by a corresponding “ASCII character” (last column in the table). This allows for a single-character representation of each possible score — as a consequence, each quality score character can conveniently correspond to (& line up with) a base character in the read. (For your reference, here is a complete lookup table — look at the top table, “BASE=33”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Our FASTQ files\n\nListing our FASTQ files\nFirst, let’s take a look at our list of FASTQ files:\nls -lh data/fastq\ntotal 150M\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 2.0M Mar  1 17:09 NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 2.6M Mar  1 17:09 NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 2.3M Mar  1 17:09 NW102C_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 3.0M Mar  1 17:09 NW102C_R2.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 1.9M Mar  1 17:09 NW103AB_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 2.6M Mar  1 17:09 NW103AB_R2.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 2.3M Mar  1 17:09 NW103C_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r-----+ 1 jelmer PAS0471 3.1M Mar  1 17:09 NW103C_R2.fastq.gz\n# [...output truncated...]\nNote in the file listing above that:\n\nThere are two files per sample: _R1 (forward reads) and _R2 (reverse reads). This indicates that we have data from paired-end reads, as is customary with amplicon metabarcoding.\nThe files all have a .gz extension, indicating they have been compressed with the gzip utility.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Viewing FASTQ files\nNext, we’ll take a peak inside one of these FASTQ files.\nThe head command prints the first lines of a file. Let’s use it try to and print 8 lines, which should show us two reads:\nhead -n 8 data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n�\nԽے�8�E��_1f�\"�QD�J��D�fs{����Yk����d��*��\n|��x���l޴�j�N������?������ٔ�bUs�Ng�Ǭ���i;_��������������|&lt;�v����3��������|���ۧ��3ĐHyƕ�bIΟD�%����Sr#~��7��ν��1y�Ai,4\nw\\]\"b�#Q����8��+[e�3d�4H���̒�l�9LVMX��U*�M����_?���\\[\"��7�s\\&lt;_���:�$���N��v�}^����sw�|�n;&lt;�&lt;�oP����\ni��k��q�ְ(G�ϫ��L�^��=��&lt;���K��j�_/�[ۭV�ns:��U��G�z�ݎ�j����&��~�F��٤ZN�'��r2z}�f\\#��:�9$�����H�݂�\"�@M����H�C�\n�0�pp���1�O��I�H�P됄�.Ȣe��Q�&gt;���\n�'�;@D8���#��St�7k�g��|�A䉻���_���d�_c������a\\�|�_�mn�]�9N������l�٢ZN�c�9u�����n��n�`��\n\"gͺ�\n    ���H�?2@�FC�S$n���Ԓh�       nԙj��望��f      �?N@�CzUlT�&�h�Pt!�r|��9~)���e�A�77�h{��~��     ��\n# [...output truncated...]\n\n\nOuch! 😳 What went wrong here? (Click for the solution)\n\nWhat happened here is that we are directly seeing the contents of the compressed file, which is simply not human-readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need to decompress\n\n\n\nTo get around the problem we just encountered with head, we might be inclined to uncompress these files, which we could do with the gunzip command. However, uncompressed files take up several times as much disk storage space as compressed ones. Fortunately, we don’t need to decompress them:\n\nAlmost any bioinformatics tool will accept compressed FASTQ files.\nWe can still view these files in compressed form, as shown below.\n\n\n\nInstead, we’ll use the less command, which will automatically display gzip-compressed files in human-readable form:\nless -S data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n@M02815:77:000000000-KPK85:1:2101:3678:10660 1:N:0:CCTAAGAC+TTCTAGCT\nCGAGCAATCCACTCGAGTGCCAGCAGCCGCAGTAATACGGAGGGTGCGAGCGTTGTCCGGAATCACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCGCGTAGGCGGCGCGGATAGTCGGCGGTGAAAGCCCGGAGCTCAACTCCGGGTCGGCCGTCGATACTTCCGGGCTTGAGCACTGTAGAGGCAGATGGAATTCCGGGTGTAGCGGTGGAATGCGTAGAGATCCGGAAGAACACCGGTGGCGAAGGCGGTCTGCTGGGCAGTTGCTGACGCTGATGCGCGACAGCGTGGGGAGCAAACAGGATTAGATACC\n+\nCCCCCGGGGGGGGGGGGGGFGGGGGGGGGG+CFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGDGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGDGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGDGGGGGGGGGGGGGGFGGFGFFFFEBFFGFFFDGFGFGBFGFGFGFFFF6?FFFGBF?FBFFF\n@M02815:77:000000000-KPK85:1:2108:2535:14400 1:N:0:CCTAAGAC+TTCTAGCT\nCGAGCAATCCACTCGAGTGTCAGCCGCCGCGGTAATACAGAGGTCCCGAGCGTTGTTCGGATTCATTGGGCGTAAAGGGTGCGTAGGCGGCGGGGAAAGTCTGATGTGAAATCCTGGGGCTCAACCCTGGAACTGCATTGGATACTTCCTTGCTAGAGTACTGGAGAGGAAACTGGAATTTACGGTGTAGCAGTGAAATGCGTAGAGATCGTAAGGAAGACCAGTGGCGAAGGCGAGTTTCTGGACAGTTACTGACGCTGAGGCACGAAGGCCAGGGGAGCAAACGGGATTAGATACC\n+\nCCCCCCGFGFGGGC-FFFGFGFFGGDFFGGGGGECGEGGAEGGGGGGGFGGDGG7CFFGGDCCFGGFCF8FGGGGGGCEGDGGGGGCGGGGGGDEGGGGBFGGDFGGGDG&lt;DFGGGGCEGGGD:FFGGGGFFGFGGFFFFGGGFGGCFGGFGGGGG9CGCGGGG7FGGC:FFGGGGGFGG&lt;?FCGGGGGGGGGGG9CG&lt;ACC?EG5CFGGGGF8CCCC:C@FGCFGGGGGC58=EEG8??77:9@:&lt;3A&gt;7AGFGGGGC?DFC?5&lt;5&gt;&gt;BGGGFGGGGG&gt;4?C42::3:DG=&gt;&lt;&lt;*)*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nless -S suppresses line-wrapping: lines in the file will not be “wrapped” across multiple lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Explore the file with less\nless doesn’t print stuff to screen but instead opens it in a “pager”.

    "text": "2 Running FastQC for 1 sample\n\n2.1 Intro to FastQC\nFastQC is a ubiquitous tools for quality control of FASTQ files. Running FastQC or a similar program is the first step in nearly any high-throughput sequencing project. FastQC is also a good introductory example of a tool with a command-line interface.\nFor each FASTQ file, FastQC outputs an HTML file that you can open in your browser with about a dozen graphs showing different QC metrics. The most important one is the per-base quality score graph shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A FastQC per-base quality score graph for files with reasonably good (left) and very poor (right) quality reads. The y-axis shows Phred quality scores (higher is better, see also the color-coding) and the x-axis shows the position along the read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Building our FastQC command\nTo run FastQC, we can use the command fastqc.\nIf you want to analyze one of your FASTQ files with default FastQC settings, a complete FastQC command to do so would simply be fastqc followed by the name of the file:\n# (Don't run this)\nfastqc data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\nHowever, an annoying FastQC default behavior is that it writes its output files in the dir where the input files are — in general, it’s not great practice to directly mix your primary data and results like that!\nTo figure out how we can change that behavior, first consider that many commands and bioinformatics tools alike have an option -h and/or --help to print usage information to the screen. Let’s try that:\nfastqc -h\nbash: fastqc: command not found...\nHowever, there is a wrinkle: while FastQC is installed at OSC1, we have to first “load it”. The way we will do this here is with a a so-called “Conda environment” that has FastQC installed along with the other programs we will need today.\nHere’s how we can load that Conda software environment — we first load OSC’s (mini)conda installation, and then we can load (“activate”) the Conda environment that I created for you:\nmodule load miniconda3\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/mbar24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda and software management\n\n\n\nWe won’t have time to get into this now, but you want to learn more about Conda / software usage at supercomputers, see this reference page elsewhere on the website.\n\n\n\n Exercise: FastQC help and output dir\nAgain try to print FastQC’s help info, and figure out which option you can use to specify a custom output directory.\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nfastqc -h and fastqc --help will both work to show the help info.\nYou’ll get quite a bit of output printed to screen, including the snippet about output directories that is reproduced below:\nfastqc -h\n  -o --outdir     Create all output files in the specified output directory.\n                    Please note that this directory must exist as the program\n                    will not create it.  If this option is not set then the \n                    output file for each sequence file is created in the same\n                    directory as the sequence file which was processed.\nSo, you can use -o or equivalently, --outdir to specify an output dir.\n\n\n\nWith the added --outdir (or -o) option, let’s try to run the following FastQC command:\n# We'll have to create the outdir ourselves, in this case\nmkdir -p results/fastqc\n\nfastqc --outdir results/fastqc data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\napplication/gzip\nStarted analysis of NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\nApprox 5% complete for NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\nApprox 10% complete for NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\nApprox 15% complete for NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n[...truncated...]\nAnalysis complete for NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\nSuccess!! 🎉\n\n\n\n2.3 FastQC output files\nLet’s take a look at the files in the output dir we specified:\nls -lh results/fastqc\ntotal 1.2M\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 713K Feb  4 14:02 NW102AB_R1_fastqc.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 431K Feb  4 14:02 NW102AB_R1_fastqc.zip\n\nThere is a .zip file, which contains tables with FastQC’s data summaries\nThere is an .html (HTML) file, which contains plots — this is what we’ll look at next\n\n\n\n Exercise: Another FastQC run\nRun FastQC for the corresponding R2 FASTQ file. Would you use the same output dir?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nYes, it makes sense to use the same output dir, since as you could see above, the output file names have the input file identifiers in them. As such, we don’t need to worry about overwriting files, and it will be easier to have all the results in a single dir.\nTo run FastQC for the R2 (reverse-read) file:\nfastqc \\\n  --outdir results/fastqc \\\n  data/fastq/NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\nStarted analysis of NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\nApprox 5% complete for NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\nApprox 10% complete for NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\nApprox 15% complete for NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\n[...truncated...]\nAnalysis complete for NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\nls -lh results/fastqc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 241K Mar 13 14:50 NW102AB_R1_fastqc.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 256K Mar 13 14:50 NW102AB_R1_fastqc.zip\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 234K Mar 13 14:53 NW102AB_R2_fastqc.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 244K Mar 13 14:53 NW102AB_R2_fastqc.zip\nNow, we have four files: two for each of our preceding successful FastQC runs."

Note that:\n\nA decrease in sequence quality along the reads is normal.\nR2 (reverse) reads are usually worse than R1 (forward) reads.\n\n\n\nGood / acceptable: \n\nBad: \n\n\nTo interpret the quality scores along the y-axis, note the color scaling in the graphs (green is good, etc.), and see this table for details:\n\n\n\nPhred quality score\nError probability\nRough interpretation\n\n\n\n\n10\n1 in 10\nterrible\n\n\n20\n1 in 100\nbad\n\n\n30\n1 in 1,000\ngood\n\n\n40\n1 in 10,000\nexcellent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer sequence quality scores\nThis shows the same quality scores we saw above, but now simply as a density plot of per-read averages, with the quality score now along the x-axis, and the number of reads with that quality score along the y-axis:\n\n\nGood:\n\n\n\n\nBad: \n\n\n\n\n\nSequence length distribution\nWill throw a warning as soon as not all sequences are of the same length (like below), but this is quite normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapter content\nChecks for known adapter sequences. When some of the insert sizes are shorter than the read length, adapters can end up in the sequence – these should be removed!\n\n\nGood: \n\nBad: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Checking your FastQC results\nFirst, you’ll unfortunately have to download FastQC’s output HTML files to your computer:\n\nFind the FastQC HTML files in the file explorer in the VS Code side bar.\nRight-click on one of them, click Download... and follow the prompt to download the file somewhere to your computer (doesn’t matter where).\nRepeat this for the second file.\nThen, open your computer’s file browser, find the downloaded files, and double-click on one. It should be opened in your default web browser.\n\n\n Exercise: Interpreting your FastQC results\n\nOpen the HTML file for the R1 FASTQ file and go through the modules we discussed above. Can you make sense of it? Does the data look good to you, overall?\nNow open the HTML file for the R2 FASTQ file and take a look just at the quality scores. Does it look any worse than the R1?"

    "text": "4 Running FastQC for all samples\nIf we want to run FastQC for all samples, it will be much better to write a shell script and submit that as a so-called Slurm batch job, rather than running FastQC “interactively” like we did for the first sample.\nThis is especially true for a complete data set, which would have much larger FASTQ files and possibly more samples.\n\n4.1 Building our script\nFirst, we will put our earlier FastQC code inside a script.\n\nOpen a new file in VS Code: click , then File, then New File.\nSave the file (e.g. press Ctrl/⌘+S) in your scripts directory as fastqc.sh.\nPaste the following code (same as we used above) in the script:\n\n# Load the software\nmodule load miniconda3\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/mbar24\n\n# Create the output dir\nmkdir -p results/fastqc\n\n# Run FastQC\nfastqc --outdir results/fastqc data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n\nHowever, we will need to modify our call to fastqc — we will loop over all FASTQ files as follows:\n# Run FastQC (replacement for fastqc line above)\nfor fastq_file in data/fastq/*fastq.gz; do\n    fastqc --outdir results/fastqc \"$fastq_file\"\ndone\n\nWe are looping over all FASTQ files with the globbing pattern data/fastq/*fastq.gz. The loop will run as many times as we have FASTQ files.\nIn every iteration of the loop, the \"$fastq_file\" variable will contain 1 FASTQ file name, and we will run fastqc for that file3.\n\n\nWe will be submitting this script as a batch job to the Slurm compute job scheduler. To do so, we should also add some lines at the top of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --account=PAS2714\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc.out\n\nThe first line #!/bin/bash merely indicates that this is a shell script4 and not say an R or Python script.\nThe lines starting with #SBATCH tell Slurm some details about our compute job request (much like we did when we filled out the form to start a VS Code session):\n\nWe always need to specify an “account”, i.e. OSC project, that should be billed.\nThe only other option (of many possible!) we will use here is to specify the output file: this is where any output will go that would otherwise be printed to screen, such as the FastQC progress output we saw above.\n\n\n\nWe will also add the following line to change some shell script settings, which will cause the script to stop running if any errors occur:\n# Strict bash settings\nset -euo pipefail\n\nAll in all, our script should read:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --account=PAS2714\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc.out\n\n# Strict bash settings\nset -euo pipefail\n\n# Load the software\nmodule load miniconda3\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/mbar24\n\n# Create the output dir\nmkdir -p results/fastqc\n\n# Run FastQC for all FASTQ files\nfor fastq_file in data/fastq/*fastq.gz; do\n    fastqc --outdir results/fastqc \"$fastq_file\"\ndone\n\n# Report\necho \"Done with script fastqc.sh\"\ndate\n\n\n\n4.2 Submitting the script\nSubmit the script to Slurm (“submit it to the queue”) with the sbatch command:\nsbatch scripts/fastqc.sh\nSubmitted batch job 27047185\nAfter some seconds (sometimes up to a minute or so5), the Slurm job should start and create the output file that we specified at the top of the script: slurm-fastqc.out.\n\n\n\n4.3 Checking the output\nEarlier, FastQC logging output (“10% complete”, etc.) was printed to screen, but because this job now runs remotely on another compute node, such output will end up in the “Slurm log file” whose name we specified in the script.

    "text": "5 Summarizing QC results with MultiQC\nHere are some challenges you may run into after running FastQC:\n\nWhen you have many FASTQ files, you’ll generate a lot of FastQC HTML files to sort through (as we did above).\nEven if you do diligently go through each file, it’s not that easy to compare the results across samples in detail, since they are not drawn in the same graphs.\n\nMultiQC addresses these problems by aggregating FastQC results from many files, and summarizing them into a single HTML file with (still) one graph per FastQC module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot just for FastQC results! MultiQC can recognize and process the output of dozens of bioinformatics tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiQC’s graphs are also interactive, but here is a static example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Running MultiQC\nWe will only need to run MultiQC once (because it will aggregate all FastQC results at once), and that will only take a few seconds — therefore, we can run the command interactively without using a script.\nLet’s start by running MultiQC (command multiqc) with the --help option:\nmultiqc --help\n# (Only the top part of the output is shown in the screenshot below)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the first couple of help lines in the paler gray color explain, MultiQC will search the [ANALYSIS DIRECTORY], a dir that we pass to it as an argument at the end of the command line. That is, if we tell MultiQC about the results/fastqc directory like so, it should find and then aggregate all the FastQC results in there:\n# (Don't run this - we'll complete the command in a second)\nmultiqc results/fastqc\nThe default output directory of MultiQC is the current working directory, so just like with FastQC, we do want to use the option for the output dir — this is our final command and you can go ahead and execute it:\n# Run MultiQC to summarize the FastQC results\nmultiqc --outdir results/multiqc results/fastqc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 MultiQC output\nOnce its done, you should have the following files in the output dir:\nls -lh results/multiqc\ntotal 1.7M\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 jelmer PAS2250 4.0K Mar  13 14:57 multiqc_data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS2250 1.7M Mar  13 14:57 multiqc_report.html\nGo ahead and find the HTML file in VS Code’s file browser, right-click on it and then download it to your computer, and click on the file in your own computer to open it in your browser (i.e., just like we did with the FastQC output).\n\n Exercise: Explore the MultiQC results\nCheck for example whether patterns are consistent across samples, or if there are any outliers."

    "text": "6 Cutadapt\nWhen you prepare samples for amplicon metabarcoding, you amplify a specific region with primers, and these primers will be included in the sequences that you receive. Before we go any further, we need to remove these primer sequences, which we can do with the program Cutadapt.\nWe will write a script with a loop to run Cutadapt for all samples and submit it a batch job like we did with FastQC.\n Open a new text file and save it as scripts/cutadapt.sh.\n\n6.1 Primer sequences\nWhen we run Cutadapt, we need to tell it about our primer sequences as well as their reverse complements. We’ll start by storing the primer sequences in variables:\n# Primer sequences\nprimer_f=GTGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA\nprimer_r=GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT\nThere are many ways of getting the reverse complement of a sequence, including manually building it up, but here we’ll use a trick with the tr command to change each base into its complement, followed by the rev command to get the reverse complement — for example, for the forward primer:\necho \"$primer_f\" | tr ATCGYRKMBDHV TAGCRYMKVHDB | rev\nTTACCGCGGCKGCTGRCACAC\nBelow, we’ll get the reverse complement for both primers, and will store those in a variable as well using the construct variable=$(command)6:\n# Get the reverse-complements of the primers\nprimer_f_rc=$(echo \"$primer_f\" | tr ATCGYRKMBDHV TAGCRYMKVHDB | rev)\nprimer_r_rc=$(echo \"$primer_r\" | tr ATCGYRKMBDHV TAGCRYMKVHDB | rev)\n\n# Check the sequences\necho \"$primer_f_rc\"\necho \"$primer_r_rc\"\nTTACCGCGGCKGCTGRCACAC\nATTAGAWACCCBNGTAGTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the above tr command\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Building the Cutadapt command\nFirst, here is how we can tell Cutadapt about the primer sequences:\nTODO add some details about the syntax\ncutadapt \\\n    -a \"$primer_f\"...\"$primer_r_rc\" \\\n    -A \"$primer_r\"...\"$primer_f_rc\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreading commands across multiple lines with \\\n\n\n\nAbove, I spread the command across multiple lines, which makes it a little easier to read. You can run the command exactly like that: the backslashes (\\) at the end of all except the last line tell the shell that our command will continue on the next line.\n\n\nWe will also:\n\nTell Cutadapt to only keep sequences that contain the primer7, with the --trimmed-only option.\nInstruct Cutadapt to use 8 “cores” with --cores 8, which can speed up the run by up to 8-fold. For our small FASTQ files, this isn’t really necessary, but for a larger dataset, that can save quite some time.\n\ncutadapt \\\n    -a \"$primer_f\"...\"$primer_r_rc\" \\\n    -A \"$primer_r\"...\"$primer_f_rc\" \\\n    --trimmed-only \\\n    --cores 8\nFinally, let’s also add the output files (--output for R1 and --paired-output for R2) and the input files (as positional arguments at the end of the command) for a single example sample. With that, we have a final example command of running Cutadapt for a single sample:\ncutadapt \\\n    -a \"$primer_f\"...\"$primer_r_rc\" \\\n    -A \"$primer_r\"...\"$primer_f_rc\" \\\n    --trimmed-only \\\n    --cores 8 \\\n    --output results/cutadapt/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz \\\n    --paired-output results/cutadapt/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz \\\n    data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz \\\n    data/fastq/NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\n\n\n\n6.3 Our Cutadapt loop\nIn our script, we will run Cutadapt inside a loop, similar to how we ran FastQC. However, this case is a bit more complicated, because we need to run Cutadapt for one sample and therefore two FASTQ files at a time, rather than for one FASTQ file at a time.\nWe will do that by looping over the R1 (forward read) files only, and inside the loop, inferring the name of the R2 file:\n# Loop over the R1 files\nfor R1_in in data/fastq/*R1.fastq.gz; do\n    # Get the R2 file name with \"parameter expansion\"\n    # This does a search-and-replace: replace \"_R1\" with \"_R2\"\n    R2_in=${R1_in/_R1/_R2}\n    \n    # Report\n    echo \"Input files: $R1_in $R2_in\"\n    \n    # Define the output files\n    R1_out=\"$outdir\"/$(basename \"$R1_in\")\n    R2_out=\"$outdir\"/$(basename \"$R2_in\")\n    \n    # Run Cutadapt\n    cutadapt \\\n            -a \"$primer_f\"...\"$primer_r_rc\" \\\n            -A \"$primer_r\"...\"$primer_f_rc\" \\\n            --trimmed-only \\\n            --cores 8 \\\n            --output \"$R1_out\" \\\n            --paired-output \"$R2_out\" \\\n            \"$R1\" \"$R2\"\ndone\n\n\n\n6.4 The final script\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --account=PAS2714\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-cutadapt.out\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8\n\n# Strict bash settings\nset -euo pipefail\n\n# Load the software\nmodule load miniconda3\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/mbar24\n\n# Primer sequences\nprimer_f=GTGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA\nprimer_r=GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT\n\n# Get the reverse-complements of the primers\nprimer_f_rc=$(echo \"$primer_f\" | tr ATCGYRKMBDHV TAGCRYMKVHDB | rev)\nprimer_r_rc=$(echo \"$primer_r\" | tr ATCGYRKMBDHV TAGCRYMKVHDB | rev)\n\n# Create the output dir\noutdir=results/cutadapt\nmkdir -p \"$outdir\"\n\n# Loop over the R1 files\nfor R1_in in data/fastq/*R1.fastq.gz; do\n    # Get the R2 file name\n    R2_in=${R1_in/_R1/_R2}\n    \n    # Report\n    echo \"Input files: $R1_in $R2_in\"\n    \n    # Define the output files\n    R1_out=\"$outdir\"/$(basename \"$R1_in\")\n    R2_out=\"$outdir\"/$(basename \"$R2_in\")\n    \n    # Run Cutadapt\n    cutadapt \\\n            -a \"$primer_f\"...\"$primer_r_rc\" \\\n            -A \"$primer_r\"...\"$primer_f_rc\" \\\n            --trimmed-only \\\n            --cores 8 \\\n            --output \"$R1_out\" \\\n            --paired-output \"$R2_out\" \\\n            \"$R1\" \"$R2\"\ndone\n\n# Report\necho \"Done with script cutadapt.sh\"\ndate\n\n\n\n6.5 Check the output\nless slurm-cutadapt.sh\nx\ntail slurm-cutadapt.sh\n22      4       0.0     2       0 3 1\n24      1       0.0     2       0 1\n25      1       0.0     2       0 0 1\n34      1       0.0     2       0 0 1\n38      2       0.0     2       0 2\n42      1       0.0     2       0 0 1\n44      1       0.0     2       0 1\n47      1       0.0     2       0 1\nDone with script cutadapt.sh\nWed Mar  6 14:46:56 EST 2024\ngrep \"with adapter:\" slurm-cutadapt.sh\n  Read 1 with adapter:                  12,798 (99.6%)\n  Read 2 with adapter:                  12,541 (97.6%)\n  Read 1 with adapter:                  14,499 (99.7%)\n  Read 2 with adapter:                  14,211 (97.7%)\n  Read 1 with adapter:                  12,174 (99.7%)\n  Read 2 with adapter:                  11,835 (97.0%)\n  Read 1 with adapter:                  15,054 (99.7%)\n  Read 2 with adapter:                  14,737 (97.6%)\n# [...output truncated...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to quickly see the lowest % of reads with adapter?

    "text": "Overview\nAt supercomputers like OSC, there are often system-wide installations of a number of bioinformatics programs. We do need to “load” such programs before we can use them. However, OSC’s collection of bioinformatics programs is unfortunately not comprehensive, and some of the available programs only come in relatively old versions.\nWe therefore also need another way to make bioinformatics programs available to ourselves. Two common methods are the Conda software management program and containers. We will talk about loading MCIC’s Conda environments, while the at-home reading covers installing software yourself with Conda, and using containers downloaded from the internet."

    "section": "1 Loading software at OSC with Lmod modules",
    "text": "1 Loading software at OSC with Lmod modules\nOSC administrators manage software with the “Lmod” system of software modules. For us users, this means that even though a lot of software is installed, most of it can only be used after we explicitly load it. That may seem like a drag, but on the upside, this practice enables the use of different versions of the same software, and of mutually incompatible software on a single system.\nWe can load, unload, and search for available software modules using the module command and its various subcommands.\n\n1.1 Checking whether a program is available\nThe OSC website has a list of installed software. You can also search for available software in the shell using two subtly different module subcommands1:\n\nmodule spider lists all modules that are installed.\nmodule avail lists modules that can be directly loaded given the current environment (i.e., taking into account which other software has been loaded).\n\nSimply running module spider or module avail would spit out the full lists of installed/available programs — it is more useful to add a search term as an argument to these commands — below, we’ll search for the Conda distribution “miniconda”, with each of these two subcommands:\nmodule spider miniconda\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  miniconda3:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Versions:\n        miniconda3/4.10.3-py37\n        miniconda3/4.12.0-py38\n        miniconda3/4.12.0-py39\n        miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  For detailed information about a specific \"miniconda3\" module (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.\n  For example:\n\n     $ module spider miniconda3/4.12.0-py39\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmodule avail miniconda\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ /apps/lmodfiles/Core -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   miniconda3/4.10.3-py37 (D)    miniconda3/4.12.0-py38    miniconda3/4.12.0-py39    miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\n\n  Where:\n   D:  Default Module\nAs stated at the bottom of the output below, the (D) in the module avail output above marks the default version of the program: this is the version of the program that will be loaded if we don’t specify a version ourselves (see examples below). The module spider command does not provide this information.\n\n\n\n1.2 Loading software\nAll other Lmod software functionality is also accessed using module subcommands. For instance, to make a program available to us we use the load subcommand:\n# Load a module:\nmodule load miniconda3               # Load the default version\nmodule load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310  # Load a specific version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModules do not remain loaded across separate shell sessions\n\n\n\nModule loading does not persist across shell sessions. Whenever you get a fresh shell session (including but not limited to after logging into OSC again), you will have to (re)load any modules you want to use!\n\n\nTo check which modules have been loaded, use module list. Its output will also include automatically loaded modules, so for example, if you loaded miniconda3/23.3.1-py310, you should see the following list where the miniconda3 module is listed as the 6th entry:\nmodule list\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) xalt/latest   2) gcc-compatibility/8.4.0   3) intel/19.0.5   4) mvapich2/2.3.3   5) modules/sp2020   6) miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\nOccasionally, when you run into conflicting (mutually incompatible) modules, it can be useful to unload modules, which you can do as follows:\nmodule unload miniconda3    # Unload a specific module\nmodule purge                # Unload all modules\n\n\n\n1.3 A practical example: FastQC again\nHere, we’ll load the module for FastQC again. First, let’s confirm that we indeed cannot currently use FastQC by running the fastqc command with the --help option:\nfastqc --help\nbash: fastqc: command not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp!\n\n\n\nMany command-line programs can be run with with a --help (and/or -h) flag, and this is often a good thing to try first, since it will tell use whether we can use the program — and if we can, we immediately get some usage information.\n\n\nNext, let’s check whether FastQC is available at OSC, and if so, in which versions:\nmodule avail fastqc\nfastqc/0.11.8\nThere is only one version available (0.11.8), which means that module load fastqc and module load fastqc/0.11.8 would each load that same version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat might still be a reason to specify the version when we load the FastQC module?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use the module load command inside a script, specifying a version would:\n\nEnsure that when we run the same script a year later, the same version would be used (assuming it hasn’t been removed) — otherwise, it’s possible a newer version would has been installed in the meantime, which might produce different results.\nMake it easy to see which version we used, which is something we typically report in papers.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s load the FastQC module:\nmodule load fastqc/0.11.8\nNow, we can retry our --help attempt:\nfastqc --help\n            FastQC - A high throughput sequence QC analysis tool\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n        fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN\n\n    fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam] \n           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN  \n# [...truncated...]\n\nOn your own: load miniconda3\nThe miniconda3 module will allow us to use Conda software environments, which we’ll talk about more below.\n\nLet’s start with a clean sheet by running module purge.\nLoad the default version of miniconda3, and then check which version was loaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (Click here)\n\n\n\n\n\nmodule load miniconda3\n\nmodule list\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) xalt/latest   2) gcc-compatibility/8.4.0   3) intel/19.0.5   4) mvapich2/2.3.3   5) modules/sp2020   6) miniconda3/4.10.3-py37\nThe version 4.10.3-py37 was loaded.\n\n\n\n\nNow load the latest version of miniconda3 without unloading the earlier version first. What output do you get?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nLmod detected that you tried to load a different version of a software that was already loaded, so it changes the version and tells you about it:\nmodule load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\nThe following have been reloaded with a version change:\n  1) miniconda3/4.10.3-py37 =&gt; miniconda3/23.3.1-py310"

    "text": "2 When software isn’t installed at OSC\nIt’s not too uncommon that software you need for your project is not installed at OSC, or that you need a more recent version of the software than what is available. In that case, the following two are generally your best options:\n\nConda, which creates software environments that you can activate much like the Lmod modules.\nContainers, which are self-contained software environments that include operating systems, akin to mini virtual machines. While Docker containers are most well-known, OSC uses Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther options to install software / get it installed\n\n\n\n\nSend an email to OSC Help. They might be able to help you with your installation, or in case of commonly used software, might be willing to perform a system-wide installation (that is, making it available through Lmod / module commands).\n“Manually” install the software, which in the best case involves downloading a directly functioning binary (executable), but more commonly requires you to “compile” (build) the program. This is sometimes straightforward but can also become extremely tricky, especially at OSC where you don’t have “administrator privileges”2 and will often have difficulties with “dependencies”3.\n\n\n\nConda and containers are useful not only at OSC, where they bypass issues with dependencies and administrator privileges, but more generally for reproducible and portable software environments. They also allow you to easily maintain distinct “environments”, each with a different version of the same software, or with mutually incompatible software.\nNext, we’ll talk about Conda and using the MCIC’s Conda environments. The at-home reading includes installing software yourself with Conda, and using containers downloaded from the internet."

    "text": "3 Intro to Conda & using MCIC’s Conda environments\nThe Conda software can create so-called environments in which one can install one or more software packages.\nAs you can see in the at-home reading below, as long as a program is available in one of the online Conda repositories (which is nearly always for bioinformatics programs), then installing it is quite straightforward, doesn’t require admin privileges, and is done with a procedure that is nearly identical regardless of the program you are installing.\nHowever, at OSC, you will probably not even have to install anything yourself, at least not if you are following “standard” workflows with common data like RNAseq. To this end, I maintain an “MCIC collection” of Conda environments that anyone can use.\nA Conda environment is just a directory, and since all the environments in this collection are in the same place at OSC, you can list the MCIC Conda environments as follows:\nls /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda\nabricate-1.0.1  bedops-2.4.39  checkm-1.2.0   entrez-direct    htseq-2.0.2          longstitch-1.0.3  nanopolish-0.13.2    prokka            repeatmasker-4.1.2.p1         samtools                star\nagat-0.9.1      bedtools       clinker        evigene          inspector-1.2.0      mafft             ncbi-datasets        pseudofinder      repeatmodeler-2.0.3           scoary                  subread-2.0.1\nalv             bioawk         clonalframeml  fastp            interproscan-5.55    maskrc-svg        nextdenovo-env       purge_dups-1.2.6  resfinder                     seqkit                  tgsgapcloser\namrfinderplus   biopython      codan-1.2      fastqc           iqtree               medaka-1.7.2      nextflow             pycoqc-2.5.2      resistomeanalyzer-2018.09.06  seqtk                   tracy-0.7.1\nantismash       bit            cogclassifier  fastq-dl         justorthologs-0.0.2  metaxa-2.2.3      orna-2.0             qiime2-2022.8     rgi-5.2.1                     signalp-6.0             transabyss-2.0.1\nariba-2.14.6    blast          cutadapt       fasttree-2.1.11  kallisto-0.48.0      minibusco         orthofinder          qualimap-env      r-metabar                     sistr-1.1.1             transdecoder-5.5.0\nastral-5.7.8    bowtie2-2.5.0  deeploc        filtlong-env     kat-2.4.2            minimap2-2.24     orthofisher          quast-5.0.2       rnaquast-2.2.1                smartdenovo-env         treetime\naswcli          bracken-2.6.1  deeptmhmm      flye-2.9.1       knsp-3.1             mlst              panaroo              quickmerge-env    roary-3.13                    snippy-4.6.0            trimgalore\nbactopia        braker2-env    deeptmhmm2     fmlrc2-0.1.7     kofamscan            mlst_check        phylofisher          racon-1.5.0       r-rnaseq                      snp-sites-2.5.1         trimmomatic-0.39\nbactopia-dev    busco          diamond        gcta             kraken2-2.1.2        mobsuite          pilon-1.24           ragtag-2.1.0      rsem-1.3.3                    soapdenovo-trans-1.0.4  trinity-2.13.2\nbakta           bwa-0.7.17     dwgsim         gffread-0.12.7   krakentools-1.2      multiqc           pkgs                 rascaf            rseqc-env                     sortmerna-env           unicycler\nbase            bwa-mem-2.2.1  eggnogmapper   gubbins          krona                mummer4           plasmidfinder-2.1.6  rcorrector-1.0.5  r_tree                        sourmash                virulencefinder\nbbmap           cactus         emboss         hisat2           liftoff-1.6.3        nanolyse-1.2.1    plink2               r-deseq           sabre-1.0                     spades-3.15.5           wtdbg-2.5\nbcftools        cgmlst         entap-0.10.8   hmmer            links-2.0.1          nanoplot          porechop             recognizer-1.8.3  salmon                        sra-tools\nThis is organized similarly to the Lmod modules in that there’s generally one separate environment for one program (and all its dependencies), and the environment is named after that program.\nThe naming of the environments is unfortunately not entirely consistent: many environments include the version number of the program, but many others do not. (Generally speaking, for environments without version numbers, you should expect the version of the program to be very recent, as I try to keep these up-to-date4).\nThis collection includes Conda environments for several programs we need during RNAseq analysis that are not installed at OSC, such as MultiQC, TrimGalore, and SortMeRNA.\n\n\n3.1 Activating Conda environments\nConda itself is already installed at OSC through Miniconda, but we always need to load its module before we can use it:\nmodule load miniconda3\nAs mentioned above, these environments are activated and deactivated in a similar manner as with the Lmod system. But whereas we use the term “load” for Lmod modules, we use “activate” for Conda environments — it means the same thing.\nAlso like Lmod, there is a main command (conda) and several subcommands (deactivate, create, install, update) for different functionality. However, for historical reasons, the most foolproof way to activate a Conda environment is to use source activate rather than the expected conda activate — for instance:\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/multiqc\n(multiqc) [jelmer@p0085 rnaseq-intro]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda environment indicator\n\n\n\nWhen we have an active Conda environment, its name is displayed in front of our prompt, as depicted above with (multiqc).\n\n\nAfter we have activated the MultiQC environment, we should be able to actually use the program.

Therefore, when you have one environment activate and then activate another, you will switch environments:\n# After running this command, the multiqc env will be active\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/multiqc\n\n# After running his command, the trimgalore env will be active...\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/trimgalore\n\n# ...but the multiqc env will no longer be:\nmultiqc --help\nbash: multiqc: command not found...\nHowever, the conda activate --stack option enables you to have multiple Conda environments active at once:\n# Assuming you had trimgalore activated, now add the multiqc env:\nconda activate --stack /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/multiqc\n\nmultiqc --help\n# (Output not shown, but this should print help info)\n\ntrim_galore --help\n# (Output not shown, but this should print help info)\nNote that the command is conda activate --stack and not source activate --stack!\n\n\n\n3.2 Lines to add to your shell script\nAs mentioned above for Lmod modules, you need to load them in every shell session you want to use them — and the same is true for Conda environments. While Conda enviroments that are loaded in your interactive shell environment will “carry over” to the environment in which your script runs (even when you submit them to the Slurm queue with sbatch; topic of the next session), it is good practice to always include the necessary code to load/activate programs in your shell scripts.\nWhen the program you will run in a script is in an Lmod module, this only involves a module load call — e.g., for FastQC:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -euo pipefail\n\n# Load software\nmodule load fastqc\nWhen the program you will run in a script is in a Conda environment, this entails a module load command to load Conda itself, followed by a source activate command to load the relevant Conda environment — e.g. for MultiQC:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Load software\nmodule load miniconda3\nsource activate /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/multiqc\n\n# Strict/safe Bash settings \nset -euo pipefail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerils of Conda environments inside scripts\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the set -euo pipefail line was moved below the source activate command, because the Conda activation procedure can otherwise result in “unbound variable” errors.\nAnother unfortunate aspect of Conda environments at OSC is the following. Problems can occur when you have a Conda environment active in your interactive shell while you submit a script as a batch job that activates a different environment.\nTherefore, it is generally a good idea to not have any Conda environments active in your interactive shell when submitting batch jobs5. To deactivate the currently active Conda environment, simply type conda deactivate without any arguments:\nconda deactivate"

    "text": "Bonus I: Creating your own Conda environments\nWhen you want to create your own Conda environments and install programs, make sure to load the most recent miniconda3 module, which is currently not the default one. This is because installation has become much quicker and less likely to fail than in earlier versions. (Note that when we are just loading environments, like above, the version doesn’t matter).\nAs of August 2023, the most recent miniconda version is 23.3.1-py310 (recall that you can list available versions with module spider):\nmodule load miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\n\nOne-time Conda configuration\nBefore we can create our own environments, we first have to do some one-time configuration6. This will set the Conda “channels” (basically, software repositories) that we want to use when we install programs, including the relative priorities among channels (since one program may be available from multiple channels).\nWe can do this configuration with the config subcommand — run the following commands in your shell:\nconda config --add channels defaults     # Added first =&gt; lowest priority\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge  # Added last =&gt; highest priority\nLet’s check whether the configuration was successfully saved:\nconda config --get channels\n--add channels 'defaults'   # lowest priority\n--add channels 'bioconda'\n--add channels 'conda-forge'   # highest priority\n\n\n\n3.3 Example: Creating an environment for Trim Galore!\nTo practice using Conda, we will now create a Conda environment with the program Trim Galore! installed. Trim Galore! is a commonly used tool for quality trimming and adapter trimming of FASTQ files — we’ll learn more about it in a later session, since we will use it on our RNAseq data. It does not have a system-wide installation at OSC, unfortunately.\nHere is the command to all at once create a new Conda environment and install Trim Galore! into that environment:\n\n# (Don't run this)\nconda create -y -n trim-galore -c bioconda trim-galore\n\nLet’s break that command down:\n\ncreate is the Conda subcommand to create a new environment.\n-y is a flag that prevents us from being asked to confirm installation once Conda has determined what needs to be installed.\nFollowing the -n option, we can specify the name of the environment, so -n trim-galore means that we want our environment to be called trim-galore. We can use whatever name we like for the environment, but of course a descriptive yet concise name is a good idea. Since we are making a single-program environment, it makes sense to simply name it after the program.\nFollowing the -c option, we can specify a “channel” (repository) from which we want to install, so -c bioconda indicates we want to use the bioconda channel. (Given that we’ve done some config above, this is not always necessary, but it can be good to be explicit.)\nThe trim-galore at the end of the line simply tells Conda to install the package of that name. This is a “positional” argument to the command (note that there’s no option like -s before it): we put any software package(s) we want to install at the end of the command.\n\n\nSpecifying a version\nIf we want to be explicit about the version we want to install, we can add the version after = following the package name, and may also want to include that version number in the Conda environment’s name — try running the command below:\nconda create -y -n trim-galore-0.6.10 -c bioconda trim-galore=0.6.10\nCollecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done  \nSolving

$ conda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you should be able to activate the enviroment (using just it’s name – see the box below):\n# Activate the environment:\nsource activate trim-galore\n\n# Test if TrimGalore can be run - note, the command is 'trim_galore': \ntrim_galore --help\n USAGE:\n\ntrim_galore [options] &lt;filename(s)&gt;\n\n-h/--help               Print this help message and exits.\n# [...truncated...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying the full path to the environment dir\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed above that we merely gave the enviroment a name (trim-galore or trim-galore-0.6.10), and did not tell it where to put this environment. Similarly, we were able to activate the environment with just its name. Conda assigns a personal default directory for its environments, somewhere in your Home directory.\nYou can install environments in a different location with the -p (instead of -n) option, for example:\nmkdir -p /fs/scratch/PAS0471/$USER/conda\nconda create -y -p /fs/scratch/PAS0471/$USER/conda/trim-galore -c bioconda trim-galore\nAnd when you want to load someone else’s Conda environments, you’ll always have to specify the full path to environment’s dir, like you did when loading an MCIC Conda environment above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Finding the Conda installation info online\nMinor variations on the conda create command above can be used to install almost any program for which a Conda package is available, which is the vast majority of open-source bioinformatics programs!\nHowever, you may be wondering how we would know:\n\nWhether the program is available and what its Conda package’s name is\nWhich Conda channel we should use\nWhich versions are available\n\nMy strategy to finding this out is to simply Google the program name together with “conda”, e.g. “cutadapt conda” if I wanted to install the CutAdapt program. Let’s see that in action:\n\n\n\nClick on that first link (it should always be the first Google hit):\n\n\n\n\nBuild the installation command\nI always take the top of the two example installation commands as a template, which is here: conda install -c bioconda cutadapt.\nYou may notice the install subcommand, which we haven’t yet seen. This would install Cutadapt into the currently activated Conda environment. Since our strategy here –and my general strategy– is to create a new environment each time you’re installing a program, just installing a program into whatever environment is currently active is not a great idea. To use the install command with a new environment, the strategy would be to first create an “empty” environment, and then run the install command.\nHowever, we saw above that we can do all of this in a single command. To build this create-plus-install command, all we need to do is replace install in the example command on the Conda website by create -y -n &lt;env-name&gt;. Then, our full command (without version specification) will be:\nconda create -y -n cutadapt -c bioconda cutadapt\nTo see which version will be installed by default, and to see which older versions are available:\n\n\n\nFor almost any other program, you can use the exact same procedure to find the Conda package and install it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few more Conda commands to manage your environments\n\n\n\n\nExport a plain-text “YAML” file that contains the instructions to recreate your currently-active environment (useful for reproducibility!)\nconda env export &gt; my_env.yml\nAnd you can use the following to create a Conda environment from such a YAML file:\nconda env create -n my_env --force --file my_env.yml\nRemove an environment entirely:\nconda env remove -n cutadapt\nList all your conda environments:\nconda env list\nList all packages (programs) installed in an environment — due to dependencies, this can be a long list, even if you only actively installed one program:\nconda list -p /fs/ess/PAS0471/jelmer/conda/multiqc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse one environment per program (as here) or one per research project\n\n\n\nBelow are two reasonable ways to organize your Conda environments, and their respective advantages:\n\nHave one environment per program (my preference)\n\nEasier to keep an overview of what you have installed\nNo need to reinstall the same program across different projects\nLess risk of running into problems with your environment due to mutually incompatible software and complicated dependency situations\n\nHave one environment per research project\n\nYou just need to activate that one environment when you’re working on your project.\nEasier when you need to share your entire project with someone else (or yourself) on a different (super)computer.\n\n\nEven though it might seem easier, a third alternative, to simply install all programs across all projects in one single environment, is not recommended. This doesn’t benefit reproducibility, and your environment is likely to stop functioning properly sooner or later.\n(A side note: even when you want to install a single program, multiple programs are in fact nearly always installed: the programs that your target program depends on, i.e. “dependencies”.)"

    "section": "Bonus II: Using Apptainer containers",
    "text": "Bonus II: Using Apptainer containers\nBesides Conda, containers are another way to use bioinformatics programs at OSC that don’t have system-wide installations.\nContainers are similar to Virtual Machines and different from Conda environments in that they come with an entire operating system. This makes creating your own container “image” (see box below on terminology) much more involved than creating a Conda environment, and we will not cover that here.\nHowever, there are pre-existing container images available for most bioinformatics programs, and they can be easily found, downloaded, and used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainer terminology\n\n\n\n\nContainer image: File (Apptainer) or files (Docker) that contain the container application.\nContainer (sensu stricto): A running container image.\nDefinition file (Apptainer) / Dockerfile (Docker): A plain text file that contains the recipe to build a container image.\n\n\n\nAmong container platforms, Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) and especially Docker are the most widely used ones. At supercomputers like OSC, however, only Apptainer containers can be used. Luckily, the Apptainer program can work with Docker container images: it will convert them on the fly.\n\nFinding container images online\nThere are several online repositories with publicly available container images, but I would recommend BioContainers https://biocontainers.pro/registry or Quay.io https://quay.io/biocontainers.\nFor example, let’s look on the BioContainers website for a TrimGalore container image:\n\n\n\n\nThe search result on the BioContainers website after entering “trim galore” in the search box.\n\n\n\nClick on the only entry that is shown, trim-galore, which will get you to a page like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this website also includes Conda installation instructions — to see the container results, scroll down and you should see this:\n\n\n\n\nAfter scrolling down on the results page, you should see a recent available container image. Note that the command shown is singularity run, but we will use the more up-to-date apptainer run later.\n\n\n\nThe version tag that is shown (0.6.9--hdfd78af_0 above) pertains to the version of TrimGalore, but the result that is shown here is not will always the container image(s) with the most recent version. To see a list of all available images, click on the Packages and Containers tab towards the top, and then sort by Last Update:\n\n\n\n\nThe logo with the large S depicts Singularity/Apptainer containers.\n\n\n\nWhenever both a Singularity/Apptainer and a Docker image for the desired version of the program is available, use the Singularity/Apptainer image. This is because those don’t have to be converted, while Docker images do. But when the version you want is only available as a Docker image, that will work too: as mentioned above, it will be automatically converted to the proper format.\n\n\n\nRunning a container image\nWhen you’ve found a container image that you want to use, copy its URL from the BioContainers website. For example, for the most recent TrimGalore version as of September 2023: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/trim-galore:0.6.10--hdfd78af_0.\nYou could also copy the full command — however, we will modify that in two ways:\n\nWe will use the more up-to-date apptainer command7\nWe’ll use the exec subcommand instead of run, which allows us to enter a custom command to run in the container (the run subcommand would only run some preset default action, which is rarely useful for our purposes).\n\nAs such, our base command to run TrimGalore in the container will be as follows:\napptainer exec https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/trim-galore:0.6.10--hdfd78af_0\n# (Don't run this, we'll need to add a TrimGalore command)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can’t use the Docker URL as-is\n\n\n\nIf you want to use a Docker container, the listed quasi-URL on BioContainers will start with “quay.io”. In your apptainer exec command, you need to preface this URL with docker://. For instance:\napptainer exec docker://quay.io/biocontainers/trim-galore:0.6.10--hdfd78af_0\n\n\nAfter the code above, we would finish our command by simply entering a TrimGalore command in the exact same way as we would when running TrimGalore outside of the context of a container. For example, to just print the help info like we’ve been doing before, the TrimGalore command is:\ntrim_galore --help\nAnd to run that inside the container, our full command will be:\napptainer exec https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/trim-galore:0.6.10--hdfd78af_0 \\\n    trim_galore --help\nINFO:    Downloading network image\n321.4MiB / 321.4MiB [===================================================================================================================================] 100 % 3.0 MiB/s 0s\nWARNING: Environment variable LD_PRELOAD already has value [], will not forward new value [/apps/xalt/xalt/lib64/libxalt_init.so] from parent process environment\n\n USAGE:\n\ntrim_galore [options] &lt;filename(s)&gt;\n\n-h/--help               Print this help message and exits.\n# [...truncated...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe Apptainer/Singularity software does not need to be loaded at OSC, it is always automatically loaded.\nThe \\ in the code above allows us to continue a command on another line.\n\n\n\nSo, all that is different from running a program inside a container versus a locally installed program, is that you prefix apptainer exec &lt;URL&gt; when using a container.\nThe first time you run this command, the container will be downloaded, which can take a few minutes (by default it will be downloaded to ~/.apptainer/cache, but you can change this by setting the $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR environment variable). After that, the downloaded image will be used and the command should be executed about as instantaneously as when running TrimGalore outside of a container.\nYou will keep seeing the warning WARNING: Environment variable LD_PRELOAD [...] whenever you run a container, but this is nothing to worry about.\nFinally, the --help option above can also simply be replaced by a host of other TrimGalore options and arguments so as to actually trim a pair of FASTQ files, i.e. with input and output files. You can just specify the paths to those files in the same way as without a container, this will work out of the box!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use a Container versus Conda\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, my default is to first try installation with Conda. But I will try a container when installing a program through Conda fails, or my Conda environment misbehaves (e.g., memory errors with dumped cores).\nWhen you need multiple programs in quick succession or in a single command (e.g., you’re piping the output of one program into a second program), it can be more convenient to have those programs installed in a single environmnent or container. Pre-built multi-program containers are not as easy to find. And since building your own Conda environment is easier than building your own container, this is a situation where you might prefer Conda."

OSC has two: “Pitzer” and “Owens”.\nSupercomputer Center\nA facility like OSC that has one or more supercomputers.\n\n\n\n3.2 Supercomputer components\nWe can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:\n\nFile Systems: Where files are stored (these are shared between the two OSC supercomputers!)\nLogin Nodes: The handful of computers everyone shares after logging in\nCompute Nodes: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile systems\nOSC has several distinct file systems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile system\nLocated within\nQuota\nBacked up?\nOne for each…\n\n\n\n\nHome\n/users/\n500 GB / 1 M files\nYes\nUser\n\n\nProject\n/fs/ess/\nFlexible\nYes\nOSC Project\n\n\nScratch\n/fs/scratch/\n100 TB\nNo\nOSC Project\n\n\n\nDuring the course, we will be working in the project directory of the course’s OSC Project PAS2714: /fs/ess/PAS2714. (We’ll talk more about these different file systems in week 5.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory is just another word for folder, often written as “dir” for short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin Nodes\nLogin nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer. There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer, they are shared among everyone, and cannot be “reserved”.\nAs such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and creating scripts for compute jobs, and are not meant for any serious computing, which should be done on the compute nodes.\n\n\n\nCompute Nodes\nData processing and analysis is done on compute nodes. You can only use compute nodes after putting in a request for resources (a “job”). The Slurm job scheduler, which we will learn to use in week 5, will then assign resources to your request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute node types\n\n\n\nCompute nodes come in different shapes and sizes. Standard, default nodes work fine for the vast majority of analyses, even with large-scale omics data. But you will sometimes need non-standard nodes, such as when you need a lot of RAM memory or need GPUs3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop, a number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC. We’ll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview:\n\n“Non-interactive” computing is common\nIt is common to write and “submit” scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.\nSoftware\nYou generally can’t install “the regular way”, and a lot of installed software needs to be “loaded”.\nOperating system\nSupercomputers run on the Linux operating system.\nLogin versus compute nodes\nAs mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing and you have to request access to “compute nodes” to run most analyses."

Under the Clusters dropdown menu, you can access a Unix shell either on Owens or Pitzer:\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m selecting a shell on the Pitzer supercomputer (“Pitzer Shell Access”), which will open a new browser tab, where the bottom of the page looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, from now on, we’ll be accessing a Unix shell inside the VS Code text editor, which also gives us some additional functionality in a user-friendly way.\n\n\n\n4.3 Interactive Apps\nWe can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs; point-and-click interfaces) via the Interactive Apps dropdown menu:\n\nSelect VS Code using the “Code Server” button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Apps like VS Code and RStudio run on compute nodes (not login nodes). Because compute nodes always need to be “reserved”, we have to fill out a form and specify the following details:\n\nThe OSC “Project” that we want to bill for the compute node usage: PAS2714.\nThe “Number of hours” we want to make a reservation for: 3\nThe “Working Directory” for the program: your personal folder in /fs/ess/PAS2714/users.\nThe “Codeserver Version”: 4.8 (most recent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Launch at the bottom, which will send your request to the “compute job” scheduler.\nFirst, your job will be “Queued” — that is, waiting for the job scheduler to allocate compute node resources to it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour job is typically granted resources within a few seconds (the card will then say “Starting”), and should be ready for usage (“Running”) in another couple of seconds:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce it appears, click on the blue Connect to VS Code button to open VS Code in a new browser tab.\nWhen VS Code opens, you may get these two pop-ups (and possibly some others) — click “Yes” (and check the box) and “Don’t Show Again”, respectively:"

Its full name is Visual Studio Code, but at OSC, it is also referred to as “Code Server”.\nTo emphasize the additional functionality relative to basic text editors like Notepad and TextEdit, editors like VS Code are also referred to as “IDEs”: Integrated Development Environments. The RStudio program is another good example of an IDE. For our purposes:\n\nVS code will be our IDE for Unix shell code\nRStudio will be our IDE for R\n\n\n\n\n5.2 The VS Code User Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide bars\nThe Activity Bar (narrow side bar) on the far left has:\n\nA  (“hamburger menu”), which has menu items like File that you often find in a top bar.\nA  (cog wheel icon) in the bottom, through which you can mainly access settings.\nIcons to toggle (wide) Side Bar options — but we’ll only use the default selection, the Explorer (file browser)\n\n\n\nEditor pane and Welcome document\nThe main part of the VS Code is the editor pane. Here, we can open files like scripts and other types of text files, and images. (Whenever you open VS Code, an editor tab with a Welcome document is automatically opened. This provides some help and some shortcuts like to recently opened files and folders.)\n\n\nTerminal (with a Unix shell)\n Open a terminal by clicking      =&gt; Terminal =&gt; New Terminal.\n\n\n\n Exercise: Try a few color themes\n\nAccess the “Color Themes” option by clicking  =&gt; Color Theme.\nTry out a few themes and see pick one you like!\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 A folder as a starting point\nConveniently, VS Code takes a specific directory as a starting point in all parts of the program:\n\nIn the file explorer in the side bar\nIn the terminal\nWhen saving files in the editor pane.\n\n(If you need to switch folders, click      =&gt;   File   =&gt;   Open Folder.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome VS Code tips and tricks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResizing panes\nYou can resize panes (the terminal, editor, and side bar) by hovering your cursor over the borders and then dragging.\nThe Command Palette\nTo access all the menu options that are available in VS Code, the so-called “Command Palette” can be handy, especially if you know what you are looking for.

    "section": "3 The basics",
    "text": "3 The basics\n\n3.1 The prompt\nInside your terminal, the “prompt” indicates that the shell is ready for a command. What is shown exactly varies across shells and can also be customized, but our prompts at OSC should show the following information:\n&lt;username&gt;@&lt;node-name&gt; &lt;working-directory&gt;]$\nFor example (note that ~ means your Home directory/folder):\n[jelmer@pitzer-login02 ~]$ \nWe type our commands after the dollar sign, and then press Enter to execute the command. When the command has finished executing, we’ll get our prompt back and can type a new command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Directory” (or “dir”) for short is Unix-speak for a computer “folder”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 A few simple commands: date, whoami, pwd\nThe Unix shell comes with hundreds of “commands”: small programs that perform specific actions. If you’re familiar with R or Python, a Unix command is like an R/Python function.\nLet’s start with a few simple commands:\n\nThe date command prints the current date and time:\ndate\nTue Mar 5 09:11:51 EST 2024\nThe whoami (who-am-i) command prints your username:\nwhoami\njelmer\nThe pwd (Print Working Directory) command prints the path to the directory you are currently located in:\npwd\n/users/PAS0471/jelmer\n# [Yours will be different! You are in your Home directory.]\n\nAll 3 of those commands provided us with some output. That output was printed to screen, which is the default behavior for nearly every Unix command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking directory and paths (we’ll talk more about paths later)\n\n\n\n\nWhen working in a Unix shell, you are always “in” a specific directory: your working directory (“working dir” for short).\nIn a path (= location of a file or directory) such as that output by pwd, directories are separated by forward slashes /.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase and spaces\n\n\n\n\nEverything in the shell is case-sensitive, including commands and file names.\nAvoid spaces in file and directory names!2 Use e.g. underscores to distinguish words (my_long_filename).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 cd and command actions & arguments\nIn the above three command line expressions:\n\nWe merely typed a command and nothing else\nThe command provided some information, which was printed to screen\n\nBut many commands perform an action other than providing information. For example, you can use the command cd to Change Directory (i.e. change your working dir). And like many commands that perform an action, cd normally has no output at all.\nLet’s use cd to move to another directory by specifying the path to that directory after the cd command:\ncd /fs/ess/PAS2714\npwd\n/fs/ess/PAS2714\nIn more abstract terms, what we did above was to provide cd with an argument, namely the path of the dir to move to. Arguments generally tell commands what file(s) or directory/ies to operate on.\nAs we’ve seen, then, cd gives no output when it successfully changed the working directory. But let’s also see what happens when it does not succeed — it gives an error:\ncd /fs/ess/PAs2714\nbash: cd: /fs/ess/PAs2714: No such file or directory\n\n\nWhat was the problem with the path we specified? (Click to see the answer)\n\nWe used a lowercase “s” in /PAs2714/ — this should have been /PAS2714/.\nAs pointed out above, everything, including paths, is case-sensitive in the Unix shell!\n\n\n\n\n3.4 ls and command options\n\nThe default behavior of ls\nThe ls command, short for “list”, will list files and directories:\nls\nsandbox   share   users\n(You should still be in /fs/ess/PAS2714. If not, cd there first.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: ls output colors (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ls output above does not show the different colors you should see in your shell — the most common ones are:\n\nEntries in blue are directories (like data and metadata above)\nEntries in black are regular files (like README.md above)\nEntries in red are compressed files (we’ll see an example soon).\n\n\n\n\nBy default, ls will list files and dirs in your current working dir, and in the way shown above. For which dir ls lists files and dirs can be changed with arguments, and how ls shows the output can be changed with options.\n\n\n\nOptions\nIn general, whereas arguments tell a command what to operate on, options will modify its behavior. For example, we can call ls with the option -l (a dash followed by a lowercase L):\nls -l \ntotal 2\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Mar  1 16:23 sandbox\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 4 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Mar  1 16:13 share\ndrwxrwxrwx+ 3 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Mar  1 16:19 users\nNotice that it lists the same items as above, but printed in a different format: one item per line, with additional information such as the date and time each file was last modified, and file sizes in bytes (to the left of the date).\nLet’s add another option, -h:\nls -l -h\ntotal 1.5K\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Mar  1 16:23 sandbox\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 4 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Mar  1 16:13 share\ndrwxrwxrwx+ 3 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Mar  1 16:19 users\n\n\nWhat is different about the output, and what do you think that means? (Click to see the answer)\n\nThe only difference is in the format of the column reporting the sizes of the items listed.\nWe now have “Human-readable filesizes” (hence -h), where sizes on the scale of kilobytes will be shown with Ks, of megabytes with Ms, and of gigabytes with Gs. That can be really useful especially for very large files.\n\nConveniently, options can be “pasted together” as follows:\nls -lh\n# (Output not shown, same as above)\n\n\n\nArguments\nArguments to ls should be dirs or files to operate on. For example, if we wanted to see what’s inside the share dir, instead of inside our working dir, we could type3:\nls share\ndata  README.md  results\n\n\n\nIntermezzo: file viewing and a quick intro to the dataset\nTo find out what data is contained in this dir, let’s take a look at the README.md file, which provides some information about the data set we will work with during the workshop.\nThere are several commands to view the contents of files — the simplest is cat, which will print the entire contents of a file to screen:\ncat share/README.md\nThis 16S amplicon metabarcoding data set compares soil bacterial populations\nunder two different rotational schemes (corn-soy) vs (corn-soy-wheat) at\ntwo research farms in Ohio (Northwest Agricultural Research Station(NW) and Western Agricultural Research Station (W)).\nThere are 32 plots (Ex: 102A) in four blocks (100-400).\nPlots were split into A and BC plots to include a cover crop treatment.\nThe head command will only print the first 10 lines of a file.

For example, cd ~ moves you to your Home dir.\n. (a single period) — represents the current working directory.\n.. (two periods) — Represents the directory “one level up”, i.e. towards the computer’s root dir.\n\n# (You should be in /fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data)\nls ..              # One level up, listing /fs/ess/PAS2714/share\ndata  README.md  results\nThis pattern can be continued all the way to the root of the computer, so ../.. means two levels up:\nls ../..            # Two levels up, listing /fs/ess/PAS2714\nsandbox  share  users\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese shortcuts work with all commands\n\n\n\nAll of the above shortcuts (., .., ~) are general shell shortcuts that work with any command that accepts a path/file name.\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Path shortcuts\n\nA) Use relative paths to move up to /fs/ess/PAS2714 and back to share/data once again.\n\n\n\n(Click for the solution)\n\ncd ../..\ncd share/data\n\n\nB) List the files in your Home dir without moving there.\n\n\n\n(Click for the solution)\n\nls ~\n# (Output not shown, will vary from person to person)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Environment variables\nYou are likely familiar with the concept of variables in either the Unix shell, R, or another language.\n\nAssigning and printing the value of a variable in R:\n\n# (Don't run this)\nx &lt;- 5\nx\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nAssigning and printing the value of a variable in the Unix shell:\nx=5\necho $x\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Unix shell code above, note that:\n\n\n\n\nThere cannot be any spaces around the = in x=5.\nYou need a $ prefix to reference (but not to assign) variables in the shell4.\nYou need the echo command, a general command to print text, to print the value of $x (cf. in R).\n\nBy the way, echo can also print literal text (as shown below) or combinations of literals and variables (next exercise):\necho \"Welcome to the Unix shell\"\nWelcome to the Unix shell\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables are pre-existing variables that have been assigned values automatically.

    "text": "5 Managing files and dirs\n\n5.1 Create dirs with mkdir\nThe mkdir command creates new directories. For example, to create your own dir within /fs/ess/PAS2714:\ncd /fs/ess/PAS2714/users\n\nmkdir $USER\nLet’s move into our newly created dir and create two directories at once:\ncd $USER\n\nmkdir scripts sandbox\nLet’s check what we did:\nls\nsandbox  scripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfused by $USER?\n\n\n\nInstead of $USER, you can also type your literal username. If you do that, make sure that you get your username exactly right, including any capitalization. For example, I (username jelmer) could have run the following commands instead of the ones above with $USER:\nmkdir jelmer\ncd jelmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Recursive mkdir with -p (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, mkdir does not work recursively: that is, it will refuse to make a dir inside a dir that does not yet exist. And if you try to do so, the resulting error might confuse you:\nmkdir sandbox/2024/02/07\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘sandbox/2024/02/07’: No such file or directory\n\nWhy won’t you do your job, mkdir!? 😡\n\nInstead, we need to use the -p option to mkdir:\nmkdir -p sandbox/2024/02/07\nThe -p option also changes mkdir’s behavior when you try to create a dir that already exists. Without -p that will result in an error, and with -p it doesn’t complain about that (and it won’t recreate/overwrite the dir either).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Copy files and dirs with cp\nAbove, you created your own directory — now, let’s get you a copy of the data we saw in the data dir.\nThe cp command copies files and/or directories from one location to another. It has two required arguments: what you want to copy (the source), and where you want to copy it to (the destination). We can summarize its basic syntax as cp &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;.\nLet’s start by copying a single file twice:\n# You should be in /fs/ess/PAS2714/users/$USER/\n\n# Only provide a dir as the destination =&gt; Don't change the file name:\ncp /fs/ess/PAS2714/sandbox/testfile.txt sandbox/\n\n# Provide a file name as the destination =&gt; Give the copy a new name:\ncp /fs/ess/PAS2714/sandbox/testfile.txt sandbox/testfile_mycopy.txt\n\n# Check the files we created:\nls sandbox\ntestfile_mycopy.txt  testfile.txt\n\ncp is not recursive by default, so if you want to copy a directory and all of its contents, you need to use its -r option. We’ll use that option to copy the dir with FASTQ files:\ncp -rv /fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data /fs/ess/PAS2714/users/$USER/\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data’ -&gt; ‘./data’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/meta’ -&gt; ‘./data/meta’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/meta/meta.tsv’ -&gt; ‘./data/meta/meta.tsv’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/ref’ -&gt; ‘./data/ref’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/ref/silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz’ -&gt; ‘./data/ref/silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/fastq’ -&gt; ‘./data/fastq’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/fastq/W404A_R2.fastq.gz’ -&gt; ‘./data/fastq/W404A_R2.fastq.gz’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/fastq/NW203A_R2.fastq.gz’ -&gt; ‘./data/fastq/NW203A_R2.fastq.gz’\n‘/fs/ess/PAS2714/share/data/fastq/W205BC_R2.fastq.gz’ -&gt; ‘./data/fastq/W205BC_R2.fastq.gz’\n# [...output truncated...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we also used the -v option, short for verbose, to make cp tell us what it did\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also get a nice recursive overview of all our files with tree:\ntree -C                 # '-C' for colors, not visible on this site though\n.\n├── data\n│   ├── fastq\n│   │   ├── NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz\n│   │   ├── NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz\n│   │   ├── NW102C_R1.fastq.gz\n│   │   ├── NW102C_R2.fastq.gz\n│   │   ├── NW103AB_R1.fastq.gz\n│   │   ├── NW103AB_R2.fastq.gz\n        ├── [...Other FASTQ files not shown...]\n│   ├── meta\n│   │   └── meta.tsv\n│   └── ref\n│       └── silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz\n├── sandbox\n│   ├── testfile_mycopy.txt\n│   └── testfile.txt\n└── scripts\n\n\n\n5.3 Move with mv, and cp/mv tips\nThe mv command is nearly identical to the cp command, except that it:\n\nMoves rather than copies files and/or dirs\nWorks recursively by default\n\nThere is no separate renaming command, as both cp and mv allow you to provide a different name for the target.\nLet’s start by moving the testfile.txt into our current working dir:\nmv sandbox/testfile.txt .\nAnd we can move and rename at the same time as well — let’s do that to move testfile.txt back and give it a new name at once:\nmv testfile.txt sandbox/testfile_v2.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwriting\n\n\n\nBy default, both mv and cp will overwrite files without warning! Use the -i (forinteractive) option to make it let you confirm before overwriting anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming rules for both cp and mv — if the destination is:\n\n\n\n\nAn existing dir, the file(s) will keep their original names.\nNot an existing dir, the path specifies the new name of the file or dir, depending on what the source is.\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Practice with mv\nIn which directory (in terms of a relative path from your working dir) would the FASTQ files end up with each of the following commands?\n\nmv data/fastq data/fastq_files\nmv data/fastq fastq\nmv data/fastq .\n\nWhat if you wanted to move the FASTQ files directly into your current working directory (from data/fastq)?\n\n\n\nSolutions (click here)\n\nIn which directory (in terms of relative path from your working dir) will the FASTQ files end up with each of the following commands?\n\nmv data/fastq data/fastq_files — in the dir fastq_files (we’ve really just renamed the dir fastq to fastq_files)\nmv data/fastq fastq — in fastq (because our source is a dir, so is the destination)\nmv data/fastq . — in fastq also! (we’d need the syntax shown below to move the individual files directly into our current dir)\n\nWhat if you wanted to move the FASTQ files directly into your current working directory?\nFor one file:\nmv data/fastq/ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz .\nFor all files:\nmv data/fastq/* .\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Remove files with rm\nThe rm command removes (deletes) files and directories.\nOne important thing to note upfront is that rm will permanently and irreversibly delete files without the typical “intermediate step” of placing them in a trash bin, like you are used to with your personal computer. With a healthy dosis of fear installed, let’s dive in.\nTo remove one or more files, you can simply pass the file names as arguments to rm as with previous commands. We will also use the -v (verbose) option to have it tell us what it did:\nrm -v sandbox/testfile_v2.txt\nremoved sandbox/testfile_v2.txt\n\n\nRecursive rm\nAs a safety measure, rm will by default only delete files and not directories or their contents — i.e., like mkdir and cp, it refuses to act recursively by default. To remove dirs and their contents, use the -r option:\n# First we create 3 levels of dirs - we need `-p` to make mkdir work recursively:\nmkdir -p d1/d2/d3\n\n# Then we try to remove the d1 dir - which fails:\nrm d1\nrm: cannot remove ‘d1’: Is a directory\n# But it does work with the '-r' option:\nrm -rv d1\nremoved directory: ‘d1/d2/d3’\nremoved directory: ‘d1/d2’\nremoved directory: ‘d1’\nYou should obviously be quite careful with rm -r!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no thrash bin when deleting files in the shell, so use rm with caution! (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nrm -r can be very dangerous — for example rm -r / would at least attempt to remove the entire contents of the computer, including the operating system.\nA couple ways to take precautions:\n\nYou can add the -i option, which will have you confirm each individual removal (can be tedious)\nWhen you intend to remove an empty dir, you can use the rmdir command which will do just (and only) that — that way, if the dir isn’t empty after all, you’ll get an error."

In the example below, our “collection” is just a short list of numbers (1, 2, and 3):\n\nfor a_number in 1 2 3; do\n    echo \"In this iteration of the loop, the number is $a_number\"\n    echo \"--------\"\ndone\n\nIn this iteration of the loop, the number is 1\n--------\nIn this iteration of the loop, the number is 2\n--------\nIn this iteration of the loop, the number is 3\n--------\n\n\nThe indented lines between do and done contain the code that is being executed as many times as there are items in the collection: in this case 3 times, as you can tell from the output above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was actually run under the hood is the following:\n\n\n\n# (Don't run this)\na_number=1\necho \"In this iteration of the loop, the number is $a_number\"\necho \"--------\"\n\na_number=2\necho \"In this iteration of the loop, the number is $a_number\"\necho \"--------\"\n\na_number=3\necho \"In this iteration of the loop, the number is $a_number\"\necho \"--------\"\n\n\nHere are two key things to understand about for loops:\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, one element in the collection is being assigned to the variable specified after for. In the example above, we used a_number as the variable name, so that variable contained 1 when the loop ran for the first time, 2 when it ran for the second time, and 3 when it ran for the third and last time.\nThe loop runs sequentially for each item in the collection, and will run exactly as many times as there are items in the collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA further explanation of for loop syntax (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the first and last, unindented lines, for loops contain the following mandatory keywords:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyword\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nfor\nAfter for, we set the variable name (an arbitrary name; above we used a_number)\n\n\nin\nAfter in, we specify the collection (list of items) we are looping over\n\n\ndo\nAfter do, we have one ore more lines specifying what to do with each item\n\n\ndone\nTells the shell we are done with the loop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining loops and globbing\nA very useful strategy is to loop over files with globbing, for example:\nfor fastq_file in data/fastq/*fastq.gz; do\n    echo \"Running an analysis for file $fastq_file\"...\n    # Additional commands to process the FASTQ file\ndone\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW102AB_R1.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW102AB_R2.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW102C_R1.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW102C_R2.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW103AB_R1.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW103AB_R2.fastq.gz...\nRunning an analysis for file data/fastq/NW103C_R1.fastq.gz...\n#[...output truncated...]\n\n\n\n Exercise: A simple loop\nCreate a loop that will print:\nmorel is an Ohio mushroom  \ndestroying_angel is an Ohio mushroom  \neyelash_cup is an Ohio mushroom\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nfor mushroom in morel destroying_angel eyelash_cup; do\n    echo \"$mushroom is an Ohio mushroom\"\ndone\nmorel is an Ohio mushroom  \ndestroying_angel is an Ohio mushroom  \neyelash_cup is an Ohio mushroom"
